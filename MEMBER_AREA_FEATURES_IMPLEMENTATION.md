# Member Area Feature Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the new member area features as requested in the requirements.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Bank Registration for Settlement
Members can now register their bank account information for settlement purposes through the profile editing page.

- **Route**: `/member/profile` (GET/PUT)
- **Page**: `EditProfile` (extends Filament's default profile page)
- **View**: Uses Filament's built-in form components

### 2. Complete Member Profile
Members can view and edit their complete profile information including personal details and banking information.

- **Routes**: 
  - `/member/profile` (GET) - Edit profile form
  - `/member/member-profile` (GET) - View profile information
- **Pages**: 
  - `EditProfile` - Custom profile editing page with bank fields
  - `MemberProfile` - Custom profile viewing page
- **Views**: 
  - `resources/views/filament/member/pages/member-profile.blade.php`

### 3. Two-Column QRIS Dashboard Layout
The member dashboard now displays QRIS codes in a two-column layout with rolling display.

- **Route**: `/member/dashboard` (GET)
- **Page**: `Dashboard` (modified)
- **View**: `resources/views/filament/member/pages/dashboard.blade.php`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes
A new migration was created to add the following fields to the `users` table:
- `phone` (string, nullable)
- `bank_name` (string, nullable)
- `account_holder_name` (string, nullable)
- `account_number` (string, nullable)

### Pages
Three pages were created/modified:
1. `EditProfile` - Extends Filament's default profile page with additional bank fields
2. `MemberProfile` - Custom page to view profile information including bank details
3. `Dashboard` - Updated to implement the two-column QRIS layout with rolling display

### Views
New views were created for:
- Member profile viewing page (`resources/views/filament/member/pages/member-profile.blade.php`)
- Updated dashboard with two-column QRIS layout (`resources/views/filament/member/pages/dashboard.blade.php`)

### Providers
- `MemberPanelProvider` was updated to use our custom `EditProfile` page and add the `MemberProfile` page to navigation

## Usage Instructions

1. Members can access their profile information by clicking on their name in the top right corner and selecting "Profile"
2. Members can edit their profile (including bank information) by clicking on their name in the top right corner and selecting "Profile" then clicking "Edit"
3. Members can view their profile information (read-only) by navigating to the "Member Profile" link in the sidebar
4. The dashboard now shows static and dynamic QRIS codes in separate columns with a rolling display mechanism

## Security Considerations

- All member routes are protected with Filament's authentication middleware
- Bank account information is only visible to the member who registered it
- Input validation is implemented through Filament's form components
