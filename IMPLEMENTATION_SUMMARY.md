# QRIS Payment Gateway - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the QRIS Payment Gateway system based on the requirements in `app_summary.md`.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Master Admin Panel
- Created using Filament 3
- Access at `/admin` with full system management capabilities
- Manage all QRIS entries (create, read, update, delete)
- User and role management

### 2. QRIS Management
- Database model for QRIS entries with fields:
  - Name
  - Bank name
  - QRIS code
  - QRIS image (optional)
  - Type (static/dynamic)
  - Active status
  - Fee percentage
- Filament resource for managing QRIS entries

### 3. QRIS Distribution System
- Implementation of multiple distribution strategies:
  - Random selection
  - Round-robin distribution
  - Specific QRIS selection
- Service class `QrisDistributionService` handles the logic

### 4. Member Dashboard
- Access at `/member` for members
- Dashboard showing:
  - Current balance
  - Recent transactions
  - Active QRIS list
- Filament member panel with role-based access

### 5. Transaction Management
- Database model for transactions with fields:
  - User reference
  - QRIS reference
  - Transaction ID
  - Amount and fees
  - Status (pending, success, failed, expired)
  - Description
  - Payment timestamp
  - Callback URL and response
- Filament resources for both admin and member views

### 6. Member Balance System
- Database model for tracking member balances:
  - User reference
  - Current balance
  - Total income
  - Total expenses
- Automatic balance updates on successful transactions

### 7. RESTful API
- Protected API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/payment/generate-qris` - Generate payment QRIS
  - `GET /api/payment/transaction/{id}` - Get transaction status
  - `GET /api/payment/qris-list` - Get list of active QRIS
- Public callback endpoint:
  - `POST /api/payment/callback` - Handle payment notifications

### 8. Callback/Notification Handler
- Automatic balance updates when payments are received
- Callback notification to merchant URLs
- Secure callback verification (simulated in this implementation)

### 9. Reporting System
- Admin reporting interface at `/admin/reports`
- Filter by date range and QRIS
- Export to CSV functionality
- Summary statistics (transaction count, total amount, total fees)

### 10. API Documentation
- Public documentation page at `/docs`
- Clear endpoint descriptions with examples
- Authentication instructions

### 11. Multi-bank Support
- Support for multiple bank QRIS in a single system
- Configurable bank list in `config/qris.php`
- QRIS tagging with bank information

### 12. Role-based Access Control
- Implementation using Spatie Permissions package
- Three roles:
  - Master Admin (full system access)
  - Admin (transaction monitoring, reports)
  - Member (dashboard, transactions)

### 13. Testing Tools
- Console commands for system testing:
  - `php artisan app:simulate-payment` - Create test transactions
  - `php artisan app:process-pendings` - Process pending transactions

## Technical Architecture

### Frameworks and Libraries
- Laravel 12
- Filament 3 (Admin Panel)
- Spatie Permissions (Role-based access)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)

### Database Structure
- Users table (Laravel default)
- QRIS table (custom)
- Transactions table (custom)
- Member balances table (custom)
- Permission tables (Spatie Permissions)

### Key Components
1. Models: `Qris`, `Transaction`, `MemberBalance`
2. Controllers: `PaymentController`, `ReportController`, `DashboardController`
3. Services: `QrisDistributionService`
4. Resources: Filament admin/member resources
5. Commands: Testing and maintenance commands

## Security Features
- Role-based access control
- API token authentication
- Input validation
- Secure callback handling (simulated)

## Configuration
- Environment-based configuration in `.env`
- Custom configuration in `config/qris.php`
- Route-based configuration in `routes/web.php` and `routes/api.php`

## Testing
- Database seeders for sample data
- Console commands for simulation
- Manual testing through API endpoints

## Deployment
- Standard Laravel deployment process
- Database migrations
- Configuration through environment variables
