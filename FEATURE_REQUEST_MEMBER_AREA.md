# Feature Request: Member Area Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the requested enhancements to the member area functionality, including bank registration, profile completion, and QRIS dashboard improvements.

## Features

### 1. Bank Registration for Settlement
**Description**: Members need a dedicated page to register their bank account information for settlement purposes.

**User Story**:

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Members can access a "Bank Registration" page from their dashboard
- Form includes fields for bank name, account holder name, and account number
- Data is validated and securely stored in the database
- Members can view and edit their registered bank information

### 2. Complete Member Profile
**Description**: Enhance the member profile to include comprehensive personal and banking information.

**User Story**:
As a member, I want to maintain a complete profile with my personal details and banking information so that the platform has accurate information for settlements.

### 3. QRIS Dashboard Layout
**Description**: Redesign the QRIS dashboard to display static and dynamic QR codes in a two-column layout.

**User Story**:
As a member, I want to easily view my static and dynamic QR codes in a clean, organized layout so that I can quickly access the QR code I need.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Dashboard is divided into two columns: "Static QRIS" and "Dynamic QRIS"
- Only one QR code is displayed per column based on a system rotation/rolling mechanism

- Implement rotation algorithm for QR code display
- Maintain consistency with existing design system and user interface patterns

## Priority
High - These features directly impact member experience and settlement processes.
