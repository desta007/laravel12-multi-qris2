- **Export**: Can export reports to CSV format

## Code Implementation

### Resource-Level Restrictions
In each Filament resource, role-based access is implemented through:

```php
public static function canViewAny(): bool
{
    return Auth::user()->hasAnyRole(['master_admin', 'admin']);
}

public static function canCreate(): bool
{
    return Auth::user()->hasAnyRole(['master_admin', 'admin']);
}

public static function canEdit($record): bool
{
    return Auth::user()->hasAnyRole(['master_admin', 'admin']);
}

public static function canDelete($record): bool
{
    return Auth::user()->hasRole('master_admin'); // Only master_admin can delete
}

public static function canDeleteAny(): bool
{
    return Auth::user()->hasRole('master_admin'); // Only master_admin can bulk delete
}
```

### Action-Level Restrictions
Table actions are conditionally displayed:

```php
->actions([
    Auth::user()->hasRole('master_admin') 
    ? Tables\Actions\EditAction::make()
    : Tables\Actions\ViewAction::make(), // Admins get view-only action
])

->bulkActions(
    Auth::user()->hasRole('master_admin') 
    ? [
        Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup::make([
            Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction::make(),
        ]),
    ]
    : [] // Admins get no bulk actions
);
```

## Testing Admin Access

### Login Credentials
- **Username**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: password

### Expected Behavior
1. After logging in, admins should be redirected to the admin dashboard
2. Admins should see navigation items for:
   - QRIS management
   - Transaction monitoring
   - Member balance monitoring
   - Reports
3. In QRIS management:
   - Should be able to create new QRIS
   - Should be able to edit existing QRIS
   - Should NOT see delete buttons
4. In Transaction monitoring:
   - Should be able to view transaction details
   - Should NOT see edit/create/delete buttons
5. In Member Balance monitoring:
   - Should be able to view balance details
   - Should NOT see edit/create/delete buttons
6. In Reports:
   - Should be able to view and filter reports
   - Should be able to export to CSV

## Security Considerations

1. **Role Validation**: All actions are validated server-side, not just UI restrictions
2. **Middleware Protection**: Routes are protected with role middleware
3. **Controller Validation**: Controllers also validate user roles
4. **Database Permissions**: Model-level permissions prevent unauthorized data changes

This implementation ensures that admins have the appropriate level of access for monitoring and managing the system without having the ability to make destructive changes that could affect system integrity.
